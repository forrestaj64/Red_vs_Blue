Vulnerability Assessment

The assessment uncovered the following critical vulnerabilities in the target:

Vulnerability 1: CVE- 2007-5461

Description:
Apache Tomcat -'WebDAV' Remote File Disclosure

Impact:
A remote authenticated user could read arbitrary files and write request via WebDAV, potential for loss of sensitive data.


Vulnerability 2: CVE- 2017-15715

Description:
LFI (Local File Inclusion) allows an attacker to read and likely execute files other than those intended to be served by the machine

Impact:
An LFI vulnerability allows attackers to gain access to sensitive credentials


Vulnerability 3: CWE 521: Weak Password

Description:
Weak passwords are vulnerable to being matched quickly with commonly available tools.

Impact:
Accounts are vulnerable to being exploited and providing attackers authenticated access to the network.


Vulnerability 4: CWE 307 : improper restriction of excessive authentication attempts

Description:
No password lockout policy in place

Impact:
An attacker is free to continually attempt to guess a password utilising brute force means.


Exploitation 1: WebDAV file disclosure

1.1 Tools & Processes
With the access credentials known, we authenticated via browser and the files in WebDAV were available.

1.2 Achievements
    Detail of a secure password contained in passwd.dav exposed remotely.
    Apache version displayed.

1.3 Exploitation Evidence
    Screenshots </images/ >

Exploitation 2: No account lockout

2.1 Tools & Processes
    The vulnerability was exploited using hydra, a brute force password matching tool. A password list file, rockyou.txt, was downloaded and utilised.

2.2 Achievements
    The password for the account of ashton was determined in short order.
    The account provides access to the “secret_folder”

2.3 Exploitation Evidence
    Screenshot of the hydra tool displaying the command executed and results: </images/ >

Exploitation 3: Local File Inclusion

3.1 Tools & Processes
    The Metasploit framework was used to create .php packaged exploits, which were copied to the machine using curl.

    A local listener is set up. The php is executed and a session is opened.

3.2 Achievements
    A remote session was achieved on the target machine. Reverse shell available

Log Analysis and Attack Characterization

Analysis: Identifying the Port Scan

</images/ >

● The port scan occurred around 04:45 am; 377 packets were sent from source IP 192.168.1.
● The activity moved from port to port, indicating that this was a port scan

Analysis: Finding the Request for the Hidden Directory

</images/ >

● There were 2 requests at 10:59 on Nov 17
● connect_to_corp_server is the filename. It contains details on how to connect to the /WebDAV share, including a hash ryan's password.

Analysis: Uncovering the Brute Force Attack

</images/ >

● 11171 requests were made in the attack
● 11170 requests had been made before the attacker discovered the password

Analysis: Finding the WebDAV Connection

Kibana Search -> 

source.ip : 192.168.1.90 and http.response.status_code : 200 and url.full : "http://192.168.1.105/webdav/"

</images/ >

● Requests made to this directory; count = 30
● Successful requests were made for the files passwd.dav and shell.php

Proposed Alarms and Mitigation Strategies

Alarm 

Mitigation: Blocking the Port Scan

We need to detect future port scans and alarm.

We can monitor the logs of recently dropped packets (iptables) and have a tool action based on the threshold.

I would suggest a threshold of; 10 hits within 60 seconds to activate this alarm.

Inotify-tools is an open source method for monitoring and setting actions


System Hardening

Linux iptables can be configured to DROP tcp packets based on the threshold;

$IPT -A INPUT -p tcp –syn -m recent

    name portscan –rcheck –seconds 60
    hitcount 10 -j LOG
    $IPT -A INPUT -p tcp –syn -m recent
    name portscan –set -j DROP

It is good practice to drop all traffic by default

    iptables -P INPUT DROP
    iptables -P FORWARD DROP
    iptables -P OUTPUT DROP
    
however we then need to specify rule chains for permitted services from and to authorised addresses or subnets.


Alarm 

Mitigation: Finding the Request for the Hidden Directory

We could set an alarm with audit.d to inform us when this file is accessed in future.

To make changes persistent, add them to the /etc/audit/audit.rulesfile

    w company_folders/secret_folder/
    connect_to_corp_server -p war -k
    connect_to_corp
    
    [w: watch. p: permission you want to audit/watch, r for read, w for write, x for execute, a for append. k: keyword for this audit rule]

In this case, the alarm threshold should be 2 hits per day.


System Hardening

Requiring simply a username / password combination is not adequate.

We should adopt certificate based authentication for the hidden directory.

Only clients with a valid certificate installed will then be able to access the hidden directory.

    openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -
    signkey server.key -out server.crt
    sudo cp server.crt /etc/ssl/certs
    sudo cp server.key /etc/ssl/private

We then need to configure our applications to use the certificate. 

This will also make the application traffic run with a secure protocol; https with SSL/TLS encryption


Alarm 

Mitigation: Preventing Brute Force Attacks

Brute force attacks involve a high volume of requests. We should establish a baseline of normal activity around a resource and report on volume anomalies.

With a normal activity level of say 50 requests per hour, the activity may be condensed to a shorter period, especially after a break.

A threshold of 100 requests in a 5 minute period would activate this alarm and not be triggered by our normal activity


System Hardening

Blocking brute force attacks on passwords can be accomplished by locking out an account after say three failed requests.

We should have an enterprise account policy that enforces this (and enforce stronger passwords). 

Another means is to return an non-standard response to failed logins, return a 200 success code with a page for “failed login”, instead of the standard 401 error.

Also, after a failed login attempt we should prompt the user to answer a secret question. This would prevent even a known password being used at this time.


Alarm 

Mitigation: Detecting the WebDAV Connection

Detecting future access to this directory could be accomplished within existing infrastructure using packet beats, with a focus on http requests to /WebDAV or via auditd.

The threshold set to activate this alarm would be based on normal usage. 

For example; if we have 10 users daily and some may request the file (http GET) more than once, I would set the alarm threshold at a count 16 in 10 hours. 

We should alarm on every http PUT request, other than those from an authorised IP address.


System Hardening

IP whitelisting; setting configuration on the host to control access could be done using an iptables rule set that allows requests and responses only from and to a listed IP.

Whitelist IP address 10.25.44.23

- allow incoming connections from workstation IP

iptables -A INPUT -s 10.25.44.23 -j ACCEPT.

- allow outgoing connections to workstation IP

iptables -A OUTPUT -d 10.25.44.23 -j ACCEPT


Alarm 

Mitigation: Identifying Reverse Shell Uploads

Setting an alarm -assuming the upload is rare, we should alert on every http PUT request. 

Where uploads are routine, every http PUT request from an unauthorised IP address should alarm.

We can set an alarm that targets specific file types, being those that are not normal for the shared folder. 

A baseline of normal activity and a threshold of normal times 2 would be a reasonable threshold at which to activate this alarm.

For .php files, we should alert for every attempt; set threshold at 1.


System Hardening

We can use specific local configuration to extend the functionality of Apache.

Placing a configured .htaccess file in a web server directory will affect all files, folders and sub-directories.

Specifically to deny a .php file to be run we insert this configuration block into our .htaccess file

    <Files *.php>
    deny from all
    </Files>
    

IMPORTANT

The Penetration Test uncovered that one employee is using the password of another to access corporate information.
    
In line with best-practice, strict role-based access controls should be enforced, including revoking access for those that no longer perform that role.
